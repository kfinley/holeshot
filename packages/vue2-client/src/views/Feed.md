<p class="pretty-print">
At Holeshot BMX we're online tools to help BMX'ers. Built by racers, for racers. We've laid the foundation of our system and currently working on a race scheduler which will provide a simple way to search for races, practices, and other events at nearby tracks then build a personal schedule to keep track of all your racing planning in a single location.
</p>
<p class="pretty-print">
In addition to a location enabled search our race scheduler also includes a race log feature that helps you track your performance over time as you train for upcoming races. We have many more features in the works and look forward to talking to more racers as we build out more race tools.

Our waitlist is open so feel free to <router-link to="/register">sign up!</router-link>
