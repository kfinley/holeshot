<p class="pretty-print">
At Holeshot BMX we build online tools to help BMX'ers. Built by racers, for racers. We've laid the foundation of our system and currently working on a race scheduler which will provide a simple way to search for races, practices, and other events at nearby tracks then let you build a personal schedule to keep track of all your racing events in a single location.
</p>
<p class="pretty-print">
In addition to a location enabled search our race scheduler also includes a race log feature so you can track your performance over time. We have many more features in the works and look forward to talking to more racers as we build out race tools.
