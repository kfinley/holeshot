Holeshot BMX is actively working on building online tools to help BMX'ers. We've laid the foundation of our system and working a race scheduler which will provide a simple way to search for events at nearby tracks and build a schedule to keep track of your racing events in a single location.
</p>
<p class="pretty-print">
Our race scheduler includes a race log feature so you can track your performance over time. We have many more features planned and are looking forward to talking to more racers as we build features.

Our waitlist is open so feel free to <router-link to="/register">sign up!</router-link>
