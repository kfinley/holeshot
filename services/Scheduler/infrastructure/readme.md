# Local Dev Infrastructure

This infrastructure is for local dev only and is loaded into the root serverless.yml for local development with Serverless Offline. It does not represent the full system infrastructure for the service. The CDK construct for this service can be found in [infrastructure/lib/scheduler-service.ts](../../../infrastructure/lib/scheduler-service.ts).
